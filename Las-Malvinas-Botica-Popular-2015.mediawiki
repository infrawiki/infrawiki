==Abstract==
<center>''This page discusses the Las Malvinas botica popular project from summer, 2015. This project entails finishing the building of the botica popular that was built by previous Practivistas students in 2013. This includes finishing all of the building's wall plaster, putting in a floor, and providing the necessary materials needed for the electric plan of the building as well. ''</center>

==Background==
This project was included in Lonny Grafman's Practivistas summer program through Humboldt State University [http://humboldt.edu/ HSU]. It took place from May 22-July 4, 2015 in the small community, Las Malvinas, located in the outskirts of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The task at hand was to finish the botica popular, which was built in summer, 2013, by other Practivista students [[Las Malvinas botica popular hullkrete 2013]]. Working with the community, seven Practivistas students designed and implemented this project based on the current criteria at hand. The project team was composed of a group of six students studying at Humboldt State University, all members of Lonny Grafman's Practivistas program. The project entailed making and applying plaster to the botica, laying out a floor for it, and providing materials needed for the electric plan of the building.

===How To===
====Apply Plaster====
Below is a table describing a common method for plastering a wall. This table is built on the assumption that one has already gathered materials/supplies and have already made the plaster being used. Also note that there are many different methods of applying plaster to a wall; the following table describes one of these ways. 

{| class="wikitable sortable"

|-
! style="background: #B2D1F0; color: black;" align="center" width="250pt"|Steps 
! style="background: #B2D1F0; color: black;" align="center" width="500pt"|Instructions 
|-
!align="center"|Step 1 [[File:Level.jpg|center|thumb|alt=Figure-1: Leveling wall using wood and a level tool.|Figure-1: Leveling the wall]]
| Level Wall. This is done often in doorways and the tops of walls so that the applied plaster will be evenly distributed along the wall of interest's perimeter. 
|-
!align="center"|Step 2 [[File:Carley.jpg|center|thumb|alt=Figure-2: Mixing the plaster in the big bucket before distributing to smaller ones.|Figure-2: Carley mixing the plaster to make sure it has a good consistency]]
|Use the trowel to mix the water in with the plaster to ensure the correct consistency; Use the trowel to lift some of the plaster and drop it. Do this three times until you have a smooth consistency.
|-
!align="center"|Step 3 [[File:Splashingwater.JPG|center|thumb|alt=Figure-3: Splashing Water.|Figure-3: Enrique splashing water in order to prep wall for plaster]]
|Water down wall. This can be done easily by poking a hole through the cap of a water bottle and then spraying the wall.
|-
!align="center"|Step 4 [[File:Apply.JPG|center|thumb|alt=Figure-4: Applying plaster.|Figure-4: Enrique applying an outward/upward pressure on the wall to make sure plaster sticks]]
|Use the trowel to lift some of the plaster and drop it.  Do this three times until you have a smooth consistency, now scoop some plaster onto the backside of a trowel and place against wall at an upward, acute angle so that the plaster is in between the wall and the trowel. Apply pressure while pressing upward (sometimes at a diagonal direction) along the wall. Plaster should stick well to the wall. 
|-
!align="center"|Step 5 [[File: Trowel.jpg|center|thumb|alt=Figure-5: Using the trowel to smooth out plaster.|Figure-5: Junior using a trowel to smooth out plaster on the wall]]
|Smooth out small areas of plaster on the wall with a flat/rectangular trowel to give the plastered part a smoother/cleaner look and then repeat this and Step 4 until the entire wall is covered in a layer of plaster.
|-
!align="center"|Step 6 [[File:Dry.JPG|center|thumb|alt=Figure-6: Drying wall.|Figure 6: Wall Drying]]
|When the wall is covered in plaster, let it dry a little bit for approximately 20 minutes. Less, the wall might be a little too wet for the next step; but more time, the wall will be too dry, making the next step difficult to tackle.
|-
!align="center"|Step 7 [[File:WoodFloat.JPG|center|thumb|alt=Figure-7: Location of Rainbow Walkway at Zane Middle School.|Figure-7:  Kaileigh using a wood float to smooth, prior to knowing the sponge technique.]]
|Smoothing time for the wall. When smoothing, the wall must be wet to use the wood float, but it's much easier to use a sponge to both wet, and smooth the wall. Using this method, push a wet sponge against the wall in circular motion. Little pressure is needed, but it depends upon how wet the sponge is (more pressure if less wet). The plaster should look blended together and well-distributed, giving the entire wall a smoother/leveled look. During this step, the plasterer must look out for uneven indents or spots on the wall and fill them using Step 4 and 5, if needed. The entire wall needs to be evened and mixed using this sponge method.
|-
!align="center"|Step 8 [[File:WallAdmiration.JPG|center|thumb|alt=Figure-8: Location of Rainbow Walkway at Zane Middle School.|Figure-8: Kaileigh and Lexie admiring the finished plaster on the bottle wall.]]
|When the plaster is dry, the wood levels can be taken down, and the wall can then be admired for eternity.

===How To===
====Plaster Test====
The following table describes the two main tests performed on a dry, plastered wall. These tests will determine whether the plaster will be sufficient in providing enough strength and resilience to use on the wall. 

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
!colspan="6" border="1" style="background:#66A3E0; color:wHITE;" align="center" |How to Perform a Plaster Test
|-
! style="background: #B2D1F0; color: black;" align="center"|Steps 
! style="background: #B2D1F0; color: black;" align="center"|Instructions 
|-
!align="center"|Step 1 [[File:WaterTestOutsideCement.jpg|center|thumb|alt=Figure-#: The Water Test.|Figure-9: Water Test]]
| The first of two tests performed for checking if the plaster used is sufficient, is called the "water test". Using a water bottle with a hole in it's cap or side is most useful. Stand in front of the wall and apply pressure to the water bottle so that it is hitting the same place on the plastered wall for about 60 seconds. The duration and distance from the wall are dependent upon the pressure of the water source. The most important thing is to keep these parameters consistent between tests, in order to make meaningful comparisons. If there is no significant indent made in the plaster, the plaster passed the water test. If the water burrows a hole in the plaster, the size of the indentations can be compared.
|-
!align="center"|Step 2 [[File:ScratchTestCarley.jpg|center|thumb|alt=Figure-#: Scratch Test.|Figure-10: Carley performing the scratch test to the plastered wall. ]]
|For the scratch test, the second test performed, one must use a metal brush to apply a consistent pressure on the wall while pressing up and down 100 times. If this creates an indent or hole in the plaster, then the plaster used will not pass this test. As with the water test, the degree of failure can be compared to determine the most promising recipes to iterate upon.
|-
!align="center"|Step 2 [[File:ScratchTestInnerDoorway.jpg|center|thumb|alt=Figure-11: Scratch Test Results.|Figure-11 Results of the scratch test performed inside the Botica. ]] 
| Scratched the wall 100 times with the wire brush. Almost all of the plaster came off.

|'''Step 2:''' Sift sand and caliche (we forgot to sift the caliche so we had to drain it out of our wet mixture and add more sifted caliche into it which required estimation).

=== Maintenance ===
Maintenance for the botica is fairly straight-forward. Since this building is so significant in the community, giving them access to cheap medicine locally, the utmost care must be given to the building. The building should be monitored for leaks on a consistent and normal basis... especially since the inner wall is covered in natural plaster, which didn't pass both plaster tests, so if exposed to weather, it can be degraded. Taking care of locking up the door at night and not letting children come play inside of the building can extend the life of its features as well.

==Conclusion==

===Testing results===
Below, are the recipes used and results gathered from the different wall plasters applied and tested.
Please not flour paste, lime, and caliche were added together into one large batch, then separated into thirds, for 3 batches. Each of the three batches was then divided by 2, and half was used for each test (for example, one black sand with secante and without hair, the other one black sand with secante and with hair). Half of the flour paste mixture for the third batch (to be used to test both sands) was lost, resulting in a smaller batch and thus a smaller quantity of sand used. Quantities of sand recorded are for one third of the batch, not for each individual test.

===Discussion===

Both types of sand performed well when the recipe included secante and excluded a fiber. However, none of the recipes passed the water test adequately for outdoor use. It was decided that the fine sand recipe would be used for the indoor plastering, and a cement recipe would be used for the outside work.

===Next steps===
The current state of the Botica Popular is that the construction is completed, paint may be added if desired,  the [http://www.appropedia.org/Practivistas_solar_2015 2015 Solar Team] installed a solar panel that provides electricity to the building as well as installed lighting.  One of the members of the community, Enrique, installed a door and windows to the building which means that all solar equipment is protected.  A floor was also installed into the Botica Popular so the only thing lacking is medicine and someone to sell the medicine.  We hope the Botica Popular will be running soon.

===Current State===
Today the Botica Popular in Las Malvinas is completed. The Naturals Building team reinforced exterior and interior of necessary areas with plaster. We perfected windows and door-ways with symmetry. The Solar team installed a fully working system. This system provides the building with electricity.  There is a door securing entry and all windows are finished. The Botica is ready for operation and business!
