=Description=
This project is an exploration of compressed earth bricks.  Mostly because they're awesome.

=Opportunity=
[[CCAT]], the campus center for [[appropriate technology]], has
recently relocated and their new grounds have many uncontrolled
hillsides.  With general erosion problems and hazards posed by
downhill water flow over clay, the need for retaining walls is
immediate.

=Literature Review=

'''Compressed Earth Brick (CEB) basics'''

Compressed earth bricks are building blocks formed from stabilized or
un-stabilized compressed earth.  The compression ranges from several
hundred pounds total, to several tons.  Because of the great gains in
durability un-stabilized bricks are only used where nothing is
available to stabilize the bricks.  In addition to stabilization, the
earth the bricks are to be made from is calibrated for durability,
workability, and survivability.

When a brick is compressed it loses 30% of its volume.  This is due
to the mechanical compression of the press driving out air pockets and
aligning wet clay particles and compacting the clay around the sand
particles.[http://www.networkearth.org/naturalbuilding/ceb.html]


'''Stabilization'''

There are many stabilizers that can be used.  They can be broadly
classed into natural and manufactured.  They include such wondrous
things as plant juices, whey, resins, molasses, wood ashes,  and lime
just to name a very few.  Here in the United States, the presence and
low cost of cement makes it both physically and economically
efficient<ref name="Stulz">Stulz, Roland, and Kiran Mukerji. Appropriate Bulding Materials. 3rd ed. UK: Swiss Centre for Development Cooperation in TEchnology and Management, 1993.</ref><ref name="Spense">Spense, R.j.s., and D.j. Cook. Building Materials in Developing Countries. New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1983.</ref>.  Some
sources don't even recommend using stabilizers other than cement even
when building in developing countries<ref name="crystal">Crystal.Netbook. Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. http://www.crystal-netbook.info/</ref>


'''Paper as a stabilizer'''

Papercrete, a cement and paper building material, has been fairly well
researched and tested.[http://www.livinginpaper.com/mixes.htm]  The
paper in papercrete is proported to have great effect as a stabilizer.  Amongst the problems with papercrete are, mold, shrinkage, and slow
drying time.[http://www.greenhomebuilding.com/articles/papercrete.htm]

In the end, process won out over product.  Only about three dozen bricks have been made so far.  That said, I am quite happy with the experience and the primary goals, education, experimentation, and repeatability, were satisfactorily met.

=Preparation=

== Earth calibration: ==
After testing your soil, preferably in multiple locations, you will
have an earth mix that is about 75% sand and at least 10% clay and
less than 35% clay, by volume.<ref name="Stulz">Stulz, Roland, and Kiran Mukerji. Appropriate Bulding Materials. 3rd ed. UK: Swiss Centre for Development Cooperation in TEchnology and Management, 1993.</ref>  The amount of
cement needed will be relational to how close you are to this ideal,
ranging from 3-5% to 10%.<ref name="Stulz">Stulz, Roland, and Kiran Mukerji. Appropriate Bulding Materials. 3rd ed. UK: Swiss Centre for Development Cooperation in TEchnology and Management, 1993.</ref>.
Now to think about making some compressed earth bricks...

== Earth Testing: ==
After reading about all of the tests, about 6 are apparently widely in use, I settled on the two most simple.  I chose, the 'block test' and 'salt water test'.  

===The block test:===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| The block test is simply, to make a block out of your earth and measure the shrinkage.  This requires a long ish box, think over a foot by 4 inches by four inches.  The sides of the box must be slippery so use an oil if the sides are rough.
| [[Image:CCAT cebs Blocktest.JPG|thumb|Three block tests, pre-shrinkage]]
|-
|}

===The salt water test:===  
To perform this test: add salt and water to a least a cup of your soil in a clear container.  Use a teaspoon ish of salt per cup of earth and cover the earth with water.  Shake it up.  Let it sit for about half an hour.  Observe and measure earth separation.

as per:

==Preface to Ram operation:==

This is ideally a group activity.  A minimum of two people are needed
to operate a CINVA-ram.  Four people is nice, six people is ideal in
my experience.  I will briefly describe a non-mechanical brick forming
method that doesn't require any more than personal conviction, and
minimal tools.

==Materials needed(for non-mechanized mixing):==

*metal rake
*several buckets(1-3)
*mixing surface(sheet of plywood, where available, to avoid mixing with cement on ground)
*marker
*shovel
*measurer (ruler, tape measure, stick, etc.)

You will need to determine your mix as it relates to your buckets.  If you are mixing down your earth with clay or sand you should be able to use the same method I've used to determine approximate cement quantities.

==Figure out your Mix==

First, fill a bucket full of earth mixture, deposit this bucket on
mixing surface.  Fill the bucket again, but only to half full, use
marker to mark half way point with line all the way around, label
line.  For that mater, label everything.  This is a group activity and
as such labels will help to avoid confusion and error.  Deposit the
second bucket on the mixing surface, form one pile, divide this pile
into 10 equal piles.  This may take a little work, don't try for
perfection, do a decent job of it and proceed.  Carefully place one of
the piles into the bucket, make tiny tick marks around the bucket at
height of the soil.  Repeat this process twice more.  Approximate
these ticks measure.  Now draw a line, up this measured distance from
your half way line.  Label this new line, which should be some small
distance above your half way line, 'cement'.  This gives you
approximately ten percent cement stabilization when measuring.  If you
are testing to determine best mix ratio, vary your cement input from
10% to 5% by halving the distance between the 'earth' and the cement
lines.  Then again halved between the 5% test line and the 10% line.
Some documentation points to the possibility of getting the cement
percentages as low as two percent.  However, if you are using another
stabilizer you will likely have to use twice as much.

Now to actually go about making some compressed earth bricks...

=Project=

I attempted to employ the old "workshop = group labor camp" ploy, with
limited success.  The most successful work group ended up being my
engineering 305 class.  In general I have to say that I have grown to
believe that most Americans are not particularly good at physical
labor anymore.  The literature proposes that the CINV-ram we have
used, which by the way was made in Bogotá, Colombia, can produce
between 40 and 60 blocks per hour<ref name="Stulz">Stulz, Roland, and Kiran Mukerji. Appropriate Bulding Materials. 3rd ed. UK: Swiss Centre for Development Cooperation in TEchnology and Management, 1993.</ref>.  The best performance we could squeeze from it was
about a quarter of that, with a 14 person team.

Teamwork means that there should be a smooth flow (See Table above) of:
{| border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"
|-
| Digging || Harvesting the earth from the best site, doing a rough sort,
picking out big rocks and plant mater.
|-
| Moving || Transporting the earth from the harvesting site to the
mesuring/sorting/mixing site.
|-
| Batching || Filling the buckets to the appropriate lines.
|-
| Mixing || Evenly distributing the cement, or other stabilizer, with the rest of the earth.
|-
| Testing || Drop testing the mix to ensure proper moisture level, adding water as necessary.
|-
| Filling || Filling the void in the press, keeping the press area tidy.
|-
| Compressing || Operating the press levers to compact brick.
|-
| Releasing || Operating the press levers to release the brick.  Removing and Transporting – Pulling the brick from the press operation and moving it to the storage area.
|-
| Stacking || Stacking the bricks and setting aside any broken bricks for reprocessing.
|-
|}


Smooth flow requires adaptation.  Jobs overlap, bottlenecks naturally
occur, people get tired, communication and fluidity of everyone's role
are the tools that craft an efficient teamwork system, which is one of the funnest things ever.

[[Image: Wateryourblocks.JPG|thumb|And remember to water your bricks!  Concrete takes Weeks if not months to fully set up.  At minimum keep wet for two weeks.]]

=Experimentation=
The compressed paper stabilized bricks that I formed are still
curing, I will keep them wet(so the cement can cure) and test them in
a month.  That said, paper made the bricks much more durable out of
the press.  Processing the paper for mixing was exhaustive.  I used a
plastic trash can to store the paper in water.


I added an eighth cup of boric acid to the mixture of 50 gallons of
paper and water to prevent molding.  Molding is widely pointed to as a
problem with paper-crete (the product closest to what I'm experimenting
with)[http://www.greenhomebuilding.com/articles/papercrete.htm].
Yet, boric acid can be used as a human safe, anti mold
agent.[http://www.moldacrossamerica.org/borates.htm].  My
paper/water/boric acid mix has been easy to handle and mold free for six
weeks so far.

I blended the paper in the water after a week with a drill mounted
mixing blade.  Then again after another week.  I then laid it to dry
on a screen atop a pallet.  


After dry I crumbled it into a bucket and
used the drill mixer again to reduce the particle size.  I would rate
this process as marginally successful.  Far too much time invested,
and the end product did not have small enough particle size for even
distribution.

=Discussion=

This is a cursory look at compressed earth brick technology.  The technology has become dominated by industry and all of my references are a decade or more old.

While the process is resource conservative, it is labor and time intensive.

My interest in new materials that are 'hyper' efficient is ever persistent, feel free to contact me with questions and comments.  eghant atgmail d0tc0m
