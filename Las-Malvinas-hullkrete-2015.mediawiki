==Abstract==
<center>''This page discusses the Las Malvinas hullkrete project from summer, 2015. This project includes: designing and testing eco blocks in Las Malvinas that successfully fit the criteria set; and using the best eco blocks to finish as much of the already-started destacamento in Las Malvinas as possible. The project team is composed of a group of six students studying at Humboldt State University [http://humboldt.edu/ HSU], all of whom are members of Lonny Grafman's Practivistas program. ''</center>

==Background==
This project was included in Lonny Grafman's Practivistas summer program through Humboldt State University. It took place from May 22-July 4, 2015 in the small community, Las Malvinas, located in the outskirts of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The  [http://http://www.appropedia.org/Las_Malvinas_destacamento Las Malvinas destacamento 2014] began in 2014 and is expected to be finished in 2015.  The team of six dug trenches to allow a place for the foundation as well as laid several blocks and rebar to create what is now a 4 foot tall perimeter with an overgrown inner area.  This team hopes to complete the wall construction of the destacamento using eco friendly blocks.  The decision of which blocks to be used will be made by testing several different recipes researched with the help of the block making factory owned by Vasquez, located in Las Malvinas.

==Objective==
The objective of this project is to construct the destacamento in Las Malvinas in the least carbon intensive way that utilizes as many waste resources as possible while providing education about resources used and creating a perfected recipe for the hullkrete ecoblocks that can then be commercially manufactured to boost the Las Malvinas economy.

===Criteria===

Below, a table of the criteria the hullkrete group decided upon is shown, each weighted with a value of importance: 10 being highest. The criteria is based off of the general consensus that the quantity of recipes for the blocks tested upon was of lesser importance than testing few known recipes and perfecting them so that they could be 1. commercially sold and produced and 2. could be used to build Las Malvina's destacamento.

===Steps to Make Blocks===
Initially the workers were adding the rice husks first because it was the most abundant material and the basis of our blocks. However, after about 2 batches they noticed that too much of the batch was getting stuck to the bottom of the machine and not being properly mixed and so the order was changed.

|-
! style="background: #B2D1F0; color: black;" align="center" width="250pt"|Steps 
! style="background: #B2D1F0; color: black;" align="center" width="500pt"|Description
|-
! 1 Measure
| Measure out materials and have ready to put into machines. This has to be done in a group of at least 4. As soon as one wheel barrel is emptied it must be filled up ASAP because the workers work really fast. 
|-
! 2 Gravel
| Its the material with the widest radius and therefore should go in first.
|-
! 3 Sand & Caliche
| Mix in the sand next because it has the 2nd largest radius. Because our recipe called for 1/2 a wheel barrel of sand and 1/2 wheel barrel of gravel, we put them in the same wheel barrel and poured them in together. However when we did separate wheel barrels, the sand and caliche alternated between going 2nd and 3rd.
|-
! 4 Rice husks
| The rice husks are very light and are used for tensile strength and should go after all the sediment.
|-
! 5 Powders
| This order varied depending on what was physically closest to the machine. What's important is that the cement and wood ash get poured in at the same time since the reason for using the ash is that it serves the same purpose as the concrete in the mix, acting as a pozzolan.   
|-
! 6 Cement & Wood Ash
| You want to mix these in together and they should be at the top of the batch because if they are poured in too early they will just stick to the bottom of the machine and be wasted.
|-
! 7 Lime
| The lime was normally pour in last or before the other powders, but just needs to be on top because it's a fine powder. Make sure to wear googles and a mask because your lungs will hurt.

===Testing Blocks===
If not given the opportunity to formally test blocks, a manual test can be done to see how easily the blocks can be broke, chipped or cracked.

===Testing results===
Below, are the recipes used for the Eco Blocks and their results from the compression test performed on them.
Please note, each batch produced roughly 24-40 blocks, with multiple rounds each producing 4 blocks at a time.
Each batch had an extra amount of cement added into the last couple rounds whose mixture was on the bottom and received less cement initially. This was done with the workers discretion, so recorded quantities are not exact.

=== Maintenance ===
Maintenance for the destacamento and building blocks include different requirements based upon if the destacamento is going to be built in the near future. It would be best not to keep the eco blocks outside in the weather: sun and rain, day after day if the  destacamento is going to be finished being built later on. Also, if the destacamento is going to be delayed being finished, the now somewhat leveled earth floors need to be upkept in that people need to refrain from throwing their basura, trash, into the building- otherwise, the ground will start to build up trash mounds again. However, if the destacamento is going to be built sooner rather than later, plastering should occur as soon as the walls are put up to protect the eco blocks from being at all degraded by the weather and surroundings.

==Conclusion==

===Testing results===
Recipe 5 preformed the best in our compression tests, this, we believe is due to recipe 5 having half the amount of rice hull than the first recipes.

===Discussion===
After our first set of test blocks were made, we were able to conduct physical tests with our feet to determine the strength and what patterns we could find involving rice hull content and strength.  Since we were unable to conduct professional tests on our initial test blocks before making more, we used what we learned from our feet tests to decide the recipe to use next.  Our second and final time at the block factory we made blocks with a new recipe which was an iteration based on our recipe 5 which preformed the best.  We also used the information we learned about the previous recipes to make the iteration.  After these blocks were made, we were able to test our initial set of six recipes and were able to officially deduce that recipe 5 was the strongest  and was approximately 30% as strong as the Dominican Republic's government requires blocks to be.
===Lessons learned===
There are a plethora of lessons learned from this project. One crucial lesson learned was to plan better. Many times trying to coordinate making eco blocks at Vasquez's factory failed because of a miscommunication of when his space and workers were accessible, and also due to not having all of the necessary supplies. It would have been way more efficient to have the entire group sit down and choose a known recipe to start with and then start making variations of recipes with lists of materials and how many blocks were desired to make in the day and quantities of materials needed to do so. Vasquez's factory is open Monday-Saturday, morning until mid to late afternoon, so the only available times the group was able to work was either full-day Sundays or part-days in the afternoons after the factory closes. The workers hired to help the team make the blocks needed to be notified and asked to stay for pay, and they expected all of the eco block materials to be at the factory and ready to go the day before. Some of the key ingredients to this year's blocks were rice hulls and wood ash. The rice hulls were located an hour away from the community, so a driver with a truck was needed, and the wood ash was off and on available at the local distillery in Las Malvinas- but needed to be sifted twice, which could take several hours depending on how much was needed. These mistakes should be read by future Practivistas students wanting to do more exploring with the blocks. 

With the destacamento, it is important to have someone- generally a community member- who knowns what he/she is doing. Someone who excels at building is crucial because there are a lot of aspects to be considered: such as leveling the blocks before adding all of the mortar, or where to add rebar, or how full to pour the mortar down the block holes. This was a lesson learned when two group members showed up at the destacamento ready to finish some layers of wall and soon realized they didn't know quite what they were doing at all. It is important to learn and listen to community members who are experts in the fields of work.

===Next steps===
So now that the building and planning and experimenting is done for the team, what are the next steps? For the community or future Practivistas students, this means more experimenting with making blocks with different variations of materials as well as finish building the destacamento. Building the destacamento with the eco blocks made is important because it makes the building more "green" and locally resourced. If a recipe is found for the eco blocks that is exceptionally efficient, maybe the community and beyond can grow to be more locally resourced and environmental.

===Current State===
The Natural Building team succeeded their goal in an ecological friendly block recipe. The recipe reduces the normal cement content thus cutting costs of manufacture.  The blocks were set through compression tests; ones that passed the compression tests were used to continue construction of the destacamento.

As far as the destacamento goes, the image below depicts the before and after shot of the progress made towards building this summer. The amount of work done to this building this summer is significant.
